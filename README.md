# Japanese Pokemon Blue Guide
This is a guide to playing Pokemon Blue (Pocket Monsters Ao) in Japanese as an English speaker.<br>
This guide contains a story-order translation of Pokemon Blue, with each line broken into 3 parts:<br>
`Kana`<br>
`Kanji`<br>
`English`<br><br>

**Example**<br>
オーキドはかせの ポケモン さいごの いっぴきだ……!<br>
オーキド博士のポケモン最後の一匹だ……!<br>
That's PROF.OAK's last POKéMON!<br>

## Translation Note
I am using the English text from Pokemon Blue.<br>
As such, some Japanese lines will be translated "loosely", rather than a precise word-for-word meaning.
