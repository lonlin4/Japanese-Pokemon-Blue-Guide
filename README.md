# Japanese Pokemon Blue Guide
This is a guide to playing Japanese Pokemon Blue (Pocket Monsters Ao) for English speakers.<br>
This guide contains a story-ordered translation of Pokemon Blue, with each line broken into 3 parts:<br>
`Kana`<br>
`Kanji`<br>
`English`<br>

**Example**<br>
オーキドはかせの ポケモン さいごの いっぴきだ……!<br>
オーキド博士のポケモン最後の一匹だ……!<br>
That's PROF.OAK's last POKéMON!<br>

**A note about the translation**<br>
I am using the English text from Pokemon Blue.<br>
As such, some Japanese lines will be translated "loosely", rather than a precise word-for-word meaning.
